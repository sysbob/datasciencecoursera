## HelloWorld


How do I make this text file into a .md file?  ( just learned that I can close the file without saving and my changes have been saved anyway.  Interesting.)

OK, now I understand.  I only have to duplicate the text file and then save it with a .md extension.

Then I open the file.md and it is opened in Mou rather than in nano and I am off to the races.

I am finding there is a lot to learn in the basics before I really can understand how to use Git and GitHub.

But the learning curve is steep right now, so with this knowledge I will gravitate over to the Git commands and see if I can learn how to make a revision control for this document.

After that I will attempt to push this document over to GitHub and see if I can share this with my class at Coursera.

Wish me luck.
